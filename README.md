## What is Recipe Shop?
- A recipe shop application that allow you to add foods as well as its ingredients and then pick ingredients to your bag.
- The main purpose of this project is to practice with `Angular` ecosystem and some third-party library that very friendly with Angular such as `NgRx` follow with its best practices.
- Therefore, this application `shouldn't be used for production` because it's created to be quite simple so as for everyone easy to understand the workflow.
You can consider using `Recipe Shop` for produciton if only `you improve it`.

**Note:** This branch is using `Angular service` as state managment. Switch to branch `ngrx` if you want to see this application's states managed by [NgRx/store](https://ngrx.io/guide/store).

- First, remember to create a `environment.ts` (development) and `environment.prod.ts` (production) files with content exactly like `environment.example.ts` file content.
